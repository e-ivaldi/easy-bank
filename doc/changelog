CHANGELOG
=========

0.1
Spring security up and running, there's a login form in the main page.
Security checks if the input user exists in the datasource 
(the datasource is an in memory database for develop and test purposes (HSQL)).
The password is stored as a SHA-512, to salt the password is used the following formula:
inverse(username).concat("X").concat(username) (timing-like generated password will be added as soon as possible).
Spring profiles are active and by default (web.xml) the app is now using the "dev" the profile.
I18n is up and running, now all the messages are only in english and italian.
